# Basic gameplay description

You are a Godzilla-esque monster being paid to demolish buildings. Clearly the demolition is going to be a key part of the gameplay. The player can get paid for the amount of damage they do, and this will comprise the player's score. Possibly the money they earn can be used to unlock upgrades, purchase items, or unlock new levels.
